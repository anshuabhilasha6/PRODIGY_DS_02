TASK 02: PERFORM DATA CLEANING AND EDA ON A DATASET OF YOUR CHOICE, SUCH AS TITANIC DATASET FROM KAGGLE. EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES AND IDENTIFY PATTERNS AND TRENDS IN THE DATA.
For this task, I performed data for cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA) .

The dataset used here is the test which I downloaded from the Kaggle.The dataset includes the Passenger Id, Class, Name, Sex,etc. It basically contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status.

Task description : The main objective of this task was to perform data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This involved handling missing values and exploring relationships between variables to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Analysis Highlights 
Conducted data Cleaning to handle missing values and duplicates.
Explored relationships between variables such as gender, passenger,class, age,fare, and survival rate .
Identified patterns and trends in the data, including the high survival rate among females,the impact of passenger class on survival and the relationship between age and survival.
